:star2::snake: Python Coding Challenge: Test-Driven Development Practice :test_tube::bulb: @channel
Challenge -1 : Implement a function called `reverse_string(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.
Your task is to write the implementation code for the `reverse_string()` function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Start by writing test cases to cover different scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.
Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1:
assert reverse_string("Hello") == "olleH"
Test Case 2:
assert reverse_string("") == ""
Remember, follow the TDD process:
:one: Think: Define the requirements and expectations for the `reverse_string()` function.
:two: Test: Write test cases that validate the expected behavior of the function.
:three: Code: Implement the `reverse_string()` function using the simplest code possible to pass the tests.
:four: Refactor: If needed, optimize and improve your code while ensuring the tests remain green.
